# Feature Engineering:
Feature Engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data. These 
features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.


Feature Engineering:
1. Feature Transformation
    * Missing Value Imputation.
    * Handling Categorical Features.
    * Outliers Detection
    * Feature Scaling: A) Standardization B) Normalization.
2. Feature Construction.
3. Feature Selection.
4. Feature Extraction.
