## Machine-Learning-Autonomous-Systems-and-Robotics.
This repository contains, the ML learning pattern that can be followed for autonomous systems. This contains all the sources that provides a deep dive into the concepts and requirements to write and perform machine learning tasks.

#Hi there, I am a enthusiast for autonomous systems, Robotics and Self Driving Cars. So from the perspective of a Mechanical Engineer who has some prior knowledge of coding in C++. This is how i am approaching and learning basic or compulsory requirements for maybe my masters or a new job in this field.

So, first of all.... I know this might sound a bit sad and boring that, u must have some good basic knowledge of maths concepts like Stats and Probabilty. Coz while i was going through the course and material of Machine Learning I felt that i should revise these concept and get a good hold of these. So, I wanted something very precise and short
course that could suffice my need and atleast introduce me to all the weird terms that were being used in the ml-course. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZzq1zSL1bs&t=4083s&ab_channel=KrishNaik was the one of the best source i referred for stats. I took me good 2-4 days to work on it(bad focus week).
Next on I wanted a theoretical start to all the basic concepts but in between i felt very vague and wondered if i could practiccal use them and feel how it actual works in code. So i had to learn Pyhton, It was easier for me to learn and understand as i already had some prior knowlede of cpp and python too that how it works and some basic syntax.
i follow a course -----. this much is enough for the syntax and s
