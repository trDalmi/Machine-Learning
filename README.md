## Machine-Learning-Autonomous-Systems-and-Robotics.
This repository contains, the ML learning pattern that can be followed for autonomous systems. This contains all the sources that provides a deep dive into the concepts and requirements to write and perform machine learning tasks.

#Hi there. I am an enthusiast for autonomous systems, Robotics, and Self-Driving Cars. So, from the perspective of a Mechanical Engineer who has some prior knowledge of coding in C++, I am approaching and learning basic or compulsory requirements for maybe my master's or a new job in this field.

So, first of all.... I know this might sound a bit sad and boring that, u must have some good basic knowledge of maths concepts like Stats and Probabilty. Coz while i was going through the course and material of Machine Learning I felt that i should revise these concept and get a good hold of these. So, I wanted something very precise and short
course that could suffice my need and atleast introduce me to all the weird terms that were being used in the course. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZzq1zSL1bs&t=4083s&ab_channel=KrishNaik was the one of the best source i referred for stats. I took me good 2-4 days to work on it(bad focus week).
Next on I wanted a theoretical start to all the basic concepts but in between i felt very vague and wondered if i could practiccal use them and feel how it actual works in code. So i had to learn Pyhton, It was easier for me to learn and understand as i already had some prior knowlede of cpp and python too that how it works and some basic syntax.
i follow a course -----. this much is enough for the syntax and logics.

And throughout the process i realised it wasnt machine learing that was particularily used in autonomous systems, but the deep learning concepts like cnn and many more algorithm and computer vision itself was part of deep learning and the perception engineering and all. I was going thorugh some profiles of people currently doing the jobs related to this field or the people pursuing the masters in this subject. So i came to know that mainly people had experience of certians years maybe of 2-3 years and had worked in a field related to this. So currently i dont really have anything that aligns with the same soo. I should probably get some good technical skills and grab some internships or jobs or maybe think of doing reserch under some professor or something. This is my plan so far down the line, it might change in future as it happens but this  is  what ive thought of doing... so lets get back to  it

Well the core concept for actual application to deal with in self driving cars lies in deep learning from where i am begginin i mean you just need a window to get into the scope of the field. so there are two major methods or technical appraoches on which todays self driving cars and autonomous robots works on. first is the four pillars. i.e. Perception, Localiztion, Planning and Control. So currently im focusing on perception. So what are the things that comes under perception or what things are included under perceptions.
computer vision
point clouds
radar 
3d construction
object tracking
prediction
sensor fusion
Now lets take a look at them one by one.
What is perception:
in simple terms, perception for autonomous systems and robots is the ability to sense and understand their surroundings. This involves using various sensors like cameras, LIDAR, and radar to collect data about the enviornmentt. This invlovles using various sensors like camers, LIDAR, and radar to collect data about the environment. The system then processes this data to recognize objects, navigate spaces, and make decision.
For example, a self-driving car usese perception to detect other vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs, allowing it to drive safely and efficiently. Essentially, perception hepls robots and autonomous sysstems "see" and interprest athe world aroundd them.
Perception in self-driving cars relies on a combination of advanced techonologies to accurately sense and interpret the environment. 
1. Computer Visioni:- cameras and deep learning algorithms(YOLO).
2. LiDAR :- 3d Mapping and point cloud processing.
3. Radar :- Object Detection and Doppler Effect
4. Sensor Fusion:-Data Intergration
5. Machine Learing and AI:-Object Detection and Tracking and semantic segmentation.
   All of these are intergrated with ROS-Robot Operating System that make the communication and control of the vehicle or robot easier.
